# Average  Annual employee salary

# Project Objective
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of gender-based salary trends across all departments within the company, with a focus on data up to the year 2002. Using SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visualization, it enables a detailed comparison of average salaries between male and female employees. This analysis seeks to uncover historical compensation patterns, providing insights into gender equity across departments and supporting informed decision-making on equitable pay practices.

 # Project Insights
The analysis provides valuable insights into salary trends across departments from 1990 to 2002:
Salaries have consistently increased across all departments, indicating a steady upward trend in employee compensation over the years.
The average salaries of male and female employees were relatively aligned until 1993. From this point onward, a pay disparity emerged, with male employees generally earning higher average salaries than their female colleagues.

# Final Conclusion
These findings suggest a gender pay gap within the organization, particularly noticeable after 1993. Although overall salary levels have grown across departments, the divergence in average pay by gender highlights a potential area for improvement. Addressing these pay discrepancies could contribute to a fairer and more inclusive workplace, reinforcing the organizationâ€™s commitment to equity and enhancing employee morale.
